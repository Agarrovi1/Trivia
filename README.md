# Trivia

A trivia app made for Tandem apprenticeship challenge prompt. Once the user click start this app creates a round of 10 questions made from the provided questions. The user can choose one of the provided 4 or 3 answers. If correct their answer will become green, if incorrect their answer will become red and the correct will show as green. A new button (an arrow pointing to the right) will appear and the user is to click it to go to the next question.

At the end of the round the user will see their score and have an option to play another round. If all the available questions are used up then the play button is disabled and a message thanking the user for playing is displayed.



# Future Implementations
- Spruce up the UI
- Change the question pool from a JSON file to a database like firebase so to add more questions I only have to add them onto firebase.
